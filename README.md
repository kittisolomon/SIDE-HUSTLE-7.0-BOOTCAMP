Building a RESTful API - SideHustle Backend Bootcamp Week 1 Task
It’s the conclusion of the first week of our bootcamp @sidehustle, and my Team and I have been working hard because we have a weekly task to complete. This week’s project appears to be pretty fascinating because it required the combination of the necessary talents.
This week’s assignment was to design a simple RESTful API capable of performing CRUD operations on a database; as a group project, we were to develop and present two distinct RESTful API’s data of our choice.
In order to complete the task, we held a group call meeting on Google Meet to discuss the task and how to approach it so that we could give it our all this week. since our Course Manager, Damilare Oyetade, put it, "the reward of a job well done is more work".

The following steps were involved in delivering the task
stage 1: grasp the task; this was the first stage, as we needed to work together as a team to help each other grasp what this week’s mission required in order for it to be completed flawlessly. This included assisting ourselves in comprehending A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a form of application programming interface (API) that adheres to the REST architecture principles. REST is a set of restrictions used to create scalable, simple, and readily managed networked applications.
Step 2: Establishing database needs; Establishing database requirements was straightforward because we understood what we wanted to construct. We made the decision to create a course registration sign up form for students.

Step 5. Writing the code

In the attached screenshots are the Image 1, the RESTful API POST request method was used, it is one of the HTTP methods used for creating new resources on the server. The Image 2 which is the GET request method, is one of the standard HTTP methods used to fetch data from a server. Image 2 contains codes used to return identical data, when the data is queried. Image 3 contains codes used to PUT or UPDATE an existing resource on the database while Image 4 contains codes used to DELETE a resource on a server, and returning response to the client in JSON format.

Step 6. Testing; In testing out the outcome of the codes, we presented a typical representation of returned resources using the JSON format, these resources are returned by querying the database, encoding them into JSON format, and returning them to the client, but won’t this be too technical for a regular non-tech user? the answer is YES! That’s where Frontend comes in, it used to consume this JSON format in a more readable format, as we would see in a giffy.
